### Task

Given a list of games and subsets of cubes revealed for each game, determine which games would have been possible if the bag had been loaded with a specific configuration of red, green, and blue cubes. Calculate the sum of the IDs of those possible games.

### Example

For instance, if the bag contained 12 red cubes, 13 green cubes, and 14 blue cubes, games 1, 2, and 5 would be possible. Games 3 and 4 would be impossible due to subset reveals exceeding the cube count limit. The sum of the IDs of the possible games would be 8.

### Solution

Find the games that are feasible based on the cube counts and sum up their IDs to derive the total sum.
